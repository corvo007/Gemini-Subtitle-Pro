## 🎯 Why Do We Need a Glossary?

When translating long videos, the most common problem is:

> "Jon Snow" translated as "Jon Snow" in minute 1, but becomes "John Snow" or "琼恩·雪" in minute 10

A **Glossary** ensures consistent terminology throughout the entire video.

## 🧠 How It Works

MioSub's terminology extraction has three stages:

### 1️⃣ Smart Recognition

After transcription, AI scans the full text to identify:
- **People**: Character names, hosts, guests
- **Places**: Cities, countries, landmarks
- **Works**: Movies, games, books
- **Terms**: Brands, technical terms, abbreviations

### 2️⃣ Translation Verification

For identified terms, MioSub:
- Searches Google for standard translations
- References Wikipedia and authoritative sources
- Prioritizes official translations

### 3️⃣ Consistent Application

During translation, the glossary is injected into every request:
- Ensures the same term uses the same translation throughout
- Prevents AI from "getting creative" with terminology

## 📋 Glossary Format

MioSub's glossary format:

```
Original | Translation | Type
Jon Snow | 琼恩·雪诺 | Name
Winterfell | 临冬城 | Place
Iron Throne | 铁王座 | Term
```

## 💡 Tips

### Manual Editing

If you're not satisfied with auto-extracted translations:
1. Click the **"Glossary"** button in the editor
2. Modify or add entries
3. Re-translate affected segments

### Scene Presets

Different content types have different terminology styles:
- **Anime**: Japanese-style naming conventions
- **Tech**: Keep English abbreviations
- **News**: Use official translations
