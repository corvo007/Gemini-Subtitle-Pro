## 🔑 API Issues

### Getting error 429?

**Meaning**: Request rate exceeded API limits.

**Solutions**:
1. **Wait a few minutes**: Free tier allows 15 requests/minute, auto-recovers
2. **Add multiple Keys**: Comma-separate multiple API Keys in settings for rotation
3. **Lower concurrency**: Reduce translation concurrency in settings

---

### "Invalid API Key" error?

1. Verify the key is complete (starts with `AIza`)
2. Check for extra spaces before/after the key
3. Try regenerating at [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)

### "Region not supported"?

Gemini API has regional restrictions. Ensure your network can access Google services.

## 🎬 Video Processing

### Video download fails?

**Common causes**:
- **Network issues**: Ensure access to YouTube/Bilibili
- **Wrong link format**: Use single video links, not playlists
- **Copyright restrictions**: B站 anime, paid content cannot be downloaded

**Solutions**:
1. Check network connection
2. Use individual video links
3. Update yt-dlp in settings

---

### Processing is slow?

**Possible causes**:
- Using CPU-only Whisper (slower)
- Network latency affecting API calls

**Optimization tips**:
1. Use smaller Whisper models (Base or Small)
2. [Configure GPU acceleration](/en/docs/guide/whisper)
3. Use Whisper API instead of local models

### FFmpeg not found?

MioSub includes FFmpeg by default, no extra setup needed.

If still getting errors:
1. Ensure you're using the full installation package
2. Check for `ffmpeg.exe` in the `resources` folder
3. Try re-downloading the full package

3. Check if source video audio has issues

### Translation quality not ideal?
